  overview:
    'In 1989, Harvey Hubbell V loaded his nephew TJ, a camera, and a bunch of tape and batteries into a Volkswagen hatchback and drove a 13,000 mile loop around the country. This documentary travelogue shows what happens when you can shoot 24 hours a day for 60 days. Shot on a $15,000 budget at the height of the "culture wars," it reveals the unique differences of a still unhomogenized citizenry, and concludes that "People who are different from us are not necessarily our enemies."',
